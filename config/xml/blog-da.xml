<p>Forget about New Year&#8217;s resolutions, we&#8217;ve got everything under control!</p>

This year, we&#8217;re going to take care of you for all 52 weeks of the year.<br />
<span id="more-19243"></span><br />
Because we know that being an online retailer means doing 12 jobs at once (you&#8217;re a developer, an accountant, a logistics coordinator, a designer, an editor, a salesperson, and more) and that it’s difficult to plan ahead and prioritize.<br />
Because it&#8217;s our mission to help you make your online store a success.<br />
And because, quite simply, we&#8217;re here to support you.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re delighted to present the <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/en/ecommerce-calendar" target="_blank">2015 e-Commerce Calendar</a>, <strong>broken down week by week and adapted to the market and events in your country.</strong></p>

<p>Is a <strong>major sales event</strong> coming up (sales, Christmas, Mother&#8217;s Day, Black Friday, etc.)? No problem! This year more than ever, you&#8217;ll have everything you need to plan ahead and understand <strong>how and when to start getting your store ready</strong>.</p>
<p>Each month, a PrestaShop merchant will also share with you <strong>a tip</strong> that has contributed to their success</p>
<p>&#8230; and if you&#8217;re not used to taking it easy, we&#8217;ll even tell you when it&#8217;s time to relax a little!</p>
<h2 style="color:#4d7e3d;">Customize your calendar</h2>
<p>All of the tips are simply suggestions from experts on how to enhance your website, help you get organized, and show you your online store in a whole new light; they are not intended to discourage you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full" title="Personas" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/01/Personas_for_B2C.jpg" alt="Personas for B2C" width="580" height="305" /></p>
<p>A buyer persona is a fictional customer who closely resembles your ideal customer. Constructing a believable, ‘human’ persona makes it much easier to understand and empathize with your customers, so building personas should be your first step –they should be ready at the planning stage of content marketing or social media campaigns.</p>
<p>Rather than cite a lot of dry statistical data, you can use that data to build a buyer persona, then internalize the customer you’re trying to attract, and relate to them as human beings.<br />
<span id="more-19252"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #2f5288;">How is a persona different from a definition of an ideal customer?</span></h4>
<p>Suppose you take some of the facts about your best-performing customers – they’re usually between 30 and 45, they normally reside in South London and they’re mostly men. If these facts describe your best-performing customers then they also describe the people your marketing should be optimized for. These are the people you want as Twitter followers and Facebook friends, and who you hope will have a naturally positive response to emails and other marketing – but it’s hard to picture them while creating content if all you have to go on are dry statistics.</p>
<p>Now meet Greg. Greg’s a 39-year-old man from South London who’s interested in your product. Even that basic description makes it easier to put a face to a name—and that’s all a buyer persona is: a fictional character who epitomizes your ideal customer. Now, instead of asking, “Will this perform well with x demographic?” you can ask yourself, “Will Greg like this?”</p>
<h4><span style="color: #2f5288;">How many customer personas do you need?</span></h4>
<p>Having just one customer persona is probably too limiting. Many experts recommend making between three and five customer personas, a number that’s big enough to represent the variety inherent in a fairly large audience, but small enough to retain the value of specificity.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #2f5288;">How do you go about constructing a persona?</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #e9705d;"><strong>Begin with a business card</strong></span></p>
<p>One way to make a customer persona is to begin with a business card template and fill in the blanks for your ideal customer. You’ll want to determine:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0 0 0 30px;">
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Job title</li>
<li>Location</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #e9705d;"><strong>Add a resume</strong></span></p>
<p>After that, add a resume with:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0 0 0 30px;">
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Career</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #e9705d;"><strong>Hopes, fears and values</strong></span><br />
Next, try to imagine your customer’s hopes, fears and values. It’s even better if you can go beyond your imagination. A great way to gain this kind of data is to use quizzes and polls on Facebook and on your site. People love these and they consistently generate engagement – plus they give you the details necessary to create true-to-life buyer personas.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e9705d;"><strong>The elevator pitch</strong></span><br />
Finally, add an ‘elevator pitch’ – one tailored specifically to this customer. Take some time on this: you’ll probably never use it “as is,” but it will give you a clear idea of what you want to say to this customer, and that clarity will come through in other messages.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #2f5288;">Bringing personas to life</span></h4>
<p>You’ll probably find that as you develop your personas, other questions need answering to really bring them to life. Some of these might include:</p>
<p><span style="color: #e9705d;"><strong>Computer literacy.</strong></span> Are your ideal customers “digital natives,” or are they wary of new technology? How precise can you get with this? It will help immensely when you design your marketing tools.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e9705d;"><strong>Hobbies.</strong></span> What does your customer do for fun? This is an important way to humanize the personas you’re creating, but it’s also an effective means of building a more complete picture and getting both depth of background and useful detail. Again, this is information that your social contacts will often be happy to divulge via polls or other interactions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #e9705d;">News sour</span><span style="color: #e9705d;">ces.</span></strong> Does Greg (remember Greg?) read <em>The Economist</em>, <em>The Guardian</em> or <em>Men’s Health</em>? Does he wait for his news sources to land on the porch or is he an RSS subscriber – or does he visit the same news websites every day?</p>
<p>This is an ‘indicator’ behavior. It tells you what news Greg cares about and how he gets it, but it also gives you broader clues about what kind of person he is, both from his preferred news sources (Fox News tends to cater to the politically conservative, while <em>Huffington Post</em> readers are usually more liberal) and formats.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e9705d;"><strong>Real quotes from actual customers</strong>,</span> drawn from interviews, polls, comments online or other sources, are a goldmine of useful information. Nothing will humanize your persona more than some actual human input.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #2f5288;">Data sources</span></h4>
<p>Where should you get the information you need to create personas?</p>
<p>Here are three good places to look:</p>
<p>Check your <span style="color: #e9705d;"><strong>site’s existing traffic analytics</strong>.</span> Site analytics will show you where your customers come from, the keywords they use to find you, how long they spend on the site once they arrive, what they look at and for how long, how much they spend and what they spend it on, and more. This set of data shows you who your audience is, what they want and how they go about getting it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e9705d;"><strong>Research your social media.</strong></span> Use social media listening skills to build an image of your customers via their Facebook and Twitter interactions with your brand. For retail-specific insights, especially ones that relate to your customers’ likes, dislikes, tastes and ideas, Pinterest is of increasing value.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e9705d;"><strong>Ask your audience</strong> </span>questions. Your customers know themselves. They know what they want and what they like – and if you give them a chance, they’ll often be very happy to tell you. Use surveys, interviews and polls to gather data that will allow you to create effective marketing personas. A persona is a fiction, but to be useful it has to be rooted in truth. Real data will reveal that truth and the more of it that comes from from customers, the better.</p>
<p>When you’re making decisions about how to orient your marketing efforts, you should almost feel like your customer persona is in the room with you. In the same way you know if your best friend is going to like something, you should know if your customer persona will like, hate, or love everything about it. And don’t forget to name your personas!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19211" title="DulzuraDePapel1" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/DulzuraDePapel1.png" alt="Selling digital products online, a Success" width="580" height="351" /></p>
<p>Dulzura de Papel is a PrestaShop store designed and developed by Jimena, a passionate graphic designer, photographer, and graphic studio owner from Buenos Aires. She found a niche market in selling customizable themed decorations for children parties such as birthdays, baby showers and baptisms.<br />
<span id="more-19210"></span><br />
Jimena’s dreams are big and she trusts PrestaShop to support her as she takes on new challenges like expanding her shop beyond Argentina’s boundaries through to the rest of the world. In this article, we share Jimena’s success story and her ecommerce advice for fellow merchants looking to sell downloadable products online.</p>
<h2 style="color: #ff61b0;">An entrepreneurial mom</h2>
<p>Through her daughter’s school, Jimena met fellow moms who inspired the idea behind Dulzura de Papel. “I wanted to create a beautiful, yet quick and easily customizable solution for moms who want a special party for their kids, but have no time to deal with decorations.” With Dulzura de Papel, customers can download customizable themed decorations for children parties.</p>
<p>“This is a slow change from my physical graphic studio to a web store that can run on its own”, shares Jimena, “and this migration will give me the flexibility to do what I love: spending time with my daughter.”</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19212" title="DulzuraDePapel2" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/DulzuraDePapel2.png" alt="An Entrepreneurial Mom" width="580" height="257" /></p>
<h2 style="color: #ff61b0;">The perfect software for her dream store</h2>
<p>Finding the perfect software wasn’t easy. “I first tried to build the store in WordPress because I was familiar with it. I bought modules and tried to install them, but it was extremely difficult. Even the WordPress Phone Support in Argentina told me it would be hard to make it work the way I wanted.”</p>
<p>Determined, Jimena searched for another software with features that will allow her to run a digital online store. “PrestaShop had everything I was looking for and even more.” Jimena was impressed with native features that allow her to successfully sell her digital products. “The stock version already has very powerful functionalities, such as the IP Geo-localization and the multi-language option.”</p>
<h2 style="color: #ff61b0;">The online marketing strategy</h2>
<p>Having launched Dulzura de Papel, the next step was to drive traffic to her website using social media and other marketing strategies. Jimena advertises her brand and concept through her Facebook page (with over 26K fans) all at the low cost of zero. To drive traffic to the website, she shares links on social media that take customers to free products on her online store. She also promotes sales on major Argentinian shopping days including: Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Children’s Day and Teacher’s Day.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19213" title="DulzuraDePapel3" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/DulzuraDePapel3.png" alt="The Online Marketing Strategy" width="580" height="291" /></p>
<h2 style="color: #ff61b0;">A simple buying process</h2>
<p>Digital products require no inventory or shipping logistics, but it is essential to have a clear and simple buying process. The checkout process should also be easy because little information is needed. Jimena shortened her checkout process, with PrestaShop Addons’ One Page Checkout.</p>
<p>Through this simplified checkout process, Dulzura de Papel’s customers make their payments, receive a link via email, then download a Zip file with High Quality PDFs.</p>
<p>Because many of Dulzura de Papel’s customers are sometimes unfamiliar with downloadable products, Jimena uses various methods to guide them:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 15px; font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: #ff31b0; font-weight: bold;">1.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Information Pages and Demo Product:</span> “How to buy” and “How it works” tabs in the main menu take you to static pages that clearly explain every step of the buying process. Customers also have access to a sample PDF that demonstrates how fast and easy it is to edit the text on the designs once they make a purchase.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff31b0; font-weight: bold;">2.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pop-Up:</span> A pop-up message is generated after each purchase, to reassure and remind customers that an email has been sent with the link to download the product.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff31b0; font-weight: bold;">3.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Guide:</span> A tutorial is attached to the email with editing and printing instruction as well as other tips and ideas.</p>
</div>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19214" title="DulzuraDePapel4" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/DulzuraDePapel4.png" alt="A Simple Buying Process" width="580" height="282" /></p>
<h2 style="color: #ff61b0;">The protection of her digital product’s copyright</h2>
<p>The same way Jimena explains the checkout process for her customers, she clarifies the terms of use. She highlights that sharing, selling or publishing any design is an infringement of Dulzura de Papel’s Copyright.</p>
<p>“PrestaShop’s software includes a digital product configuration that generates download links valid only for 30 days after the purchase, limited to up to 3 downloads. This is great because it limits the risk of diffusion.” Additionally, Jimena password protects the products in case a customer tries to open it on any design software to modify the illustrations. “Because all the products include a trademark that reads ‘dulzuradepapel.com’, I don’t want anyone to modify the design. Of course, you can’t control absolutely everything that customers do, but these are great ways of enforcing copyright rules.”</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19215" title="DulzuraDePapel5" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/DulzuraDePapel5.png" alt="The protection of her digital product’s copyright" width="580" height="327" /></p>
<h2 style="color: #ff61b0;">The future of Dulzura de Papel</h2>
<p>“Most of my customers come from Argentina, Mexico and other Spanish speaking countries,” claims Jimena, “For now my store is only available in Spanish. My plan is to translate my website into different languages, starting with English and Portuguese, so that people from anywhere in the world will be able to buy and download my designs. PrestaShop allows me to do just that.”</p>
<p>“My advice to all the merchants starting out is to take the step. PrestaShop is a safe, versatile and dynamic software with many benefits and options that can make almost anything come true.” Jimena’s dedication led her to create a beautiful and successful online store with PrestaShop &#8212; turning her dream into a reality.</p>

<p>It seems like just yesterday we were making summer plans, but with a blink of an eye, the year has passed and we’re almost into 2015. Throughout this year, we’ve seen some great newsletters from PrestaShop merchants.</p>
<p>Although it was hard, we’ve narrowed them down to the top 10 ecommerce newsletters of 2014. We’ve listed each newsletter’s subject line, shop, reasons why we think it’s great and what you should try next year. Let’s get started!</p>
<p><span id="more-19168"></span></p>
<div style="float: left; width: 340px; margin-right: 10px;">
<h4 style="color: #1296a3;"><span style="color: #000000;">1.</span> Thank You for Signing Up &#8211; Here is Your Voucher! by <a style="color: #1296a3; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.bloch.com.au/" target="_blank">Bloch Australia</a></h4>
<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> This email rewards customers for subscribing to newsletter and encourages them to shop with a discount code. The timeliness of this coupon code is key in driving conversions and convincing customers to make their first purchase.<br />
<strong>What to try:</strong> Welcome new customers with a coupon.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=9c73a1a1b6076ffb51472af60&amp;id=cbcc67ef03&amp;e=3598629b90" target="_blank">View it live</a>)</p>
</div>
<p><img class=" wp-image-19170 alignright" title="1. Thank You for Signing Up Here is Your Voucher" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/1.-Thank-You-for-Signing-Up-Here-is-Your-Voucher.png" alt="Bloch Australia" width="210" height="280" /></p>
<div style="float: left; width: 340px; margin-right: 10px;">
<h4 style="color: #1296a3;"><span style="color: #000000;">2.</span> International Delivery &amp; New Tools by <a style="color: #1296a3; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.eatingtools.com/" target="_blank">Eating Tools</a></h4>
<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Newsletters give the perfect opportunity to reach out to your customers. Use it to tell them about new services like international shipping or new products. This newsletter does a great job at both and draws us in by share the new product’s story.<br />
<strong>What to try:</strong> Tell customers about new services!</p>

<h4 style="color: #1296a3;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.</span> ARTOYZ NEWS 211 : Artoyz’s new look with news! by <a style="color: #1296a3; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://artoyz.com/" target="_blank">Artoyz</a></h4>
<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> This newsletter announces the new shop design so customers expect and aren’t confused by the updated design. Most merchants get so excited for their new website design, they forget to tell customers about it – don’t let it be you.<br />
<strong>What to try:</strong> Announce your website redesign.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/?u=5fc4d904321aa12ac274e17be&amp;id=08449cf5da&amp;e=951556627b" target="_blank">View it live</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Timefy features the brand, Citizen, up and center in both the subject line and newsletter content. It’s great for building your store’s credibility and grabbing your customers’ attention. This is especially true if you sell well-known brand names.<br />
<strong>What to try:</strong> Highlight popular brands.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> To start, we love their super short subject line because it’s effortless to read. Once you open the email, the newsletter is dedicated entirely to one topic, or in this case, color &#8211; Bordeaux.<br />
<strong>What to try:</strong> Feature a season’s hottest color.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=ebdd970f3e0157c26ecb9f6cf&amp;id=a8d17f9b8d&amp;e=1de933fd50" target="_blank">View it live</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Try adding some pizazz to your 2015 newsletters with .gif images. Bimba y Lola used them to feature multiple products at once, while keeping the email short and simple. Get started by creating your own with this free <a href="http://gifmaker.me/" target="_blank">online gif maker</a>.<br />
<strong>What to try:</strong> Bring products to life with gifs.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> The personalization in the subject line immediately grabs our attention. Adding your customers’ name can make a standard message seem personal. Then once a customer opens this newsletter, there is a coupon code enticing customers (like me) to shop.<br />
<strong>What to try:</strong> Personalize emails with customer information.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://condura.cmail2.com/t/ViewEmail/t/1E34C373FBF72796/34BA5AA3877E8DFD6A4D01E12DB8921D" target="_blank">View it live</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> The subject lines does a great job summarizing the entire newsletter. Even before I open it, I know the deals I can expect within the email. If I’m looking for something in particular, I know where it is listed.<br />
<strong>What to try:</strong> Promote your sale in the subject line</p>

<p>Have you ever thought about the purpose of the links on the footer of every website? How about the static pages those links take you, such as the &#8220;About Us&#8221;, &#8220;Delivery&#8221;, &#8220;Legal Notice&#8221; or &#8220;Terms and Conditions&#8221;?</p>
<p>Even if tiny fonts and complex sentence structures make you want to ignore their existence, these pages can affect your brand’s reputation, your store’s reliability and most importantly, your company’s legal status.</p>
<p>This article guides you through the process of writing your online store’s CMS pages, and explains how to add and modify them in your PrestaShop Back Office.<br />
<span id="more-19089"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #6b7c5b;"><span style="color: #f2a9cd;">1.</span> Look around</span></h2>
<p>Just look, don&#8217;t look-copy-paste move. Every company’s needs are different and your CMS pages should be customized to fit them. This doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t check out your competition. On the contrary, your competitors can sometimes be your best guide!</p>
<p>Locate your competitors&#8217; list of CMS pages and check them out! Analyze their content, strong points, weak points, tone of voice, and layout (including screenshots, videos, and forms). You now have a good framework to help you work the next step: self-analysis.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6b7c5b;"><span style="color: #f2a9cd;">2. </span>Think of your company</span></h2>
<p>Brainstorm and define the 2 most important aspects of your CMS page content:</p>
<div style="padding: 0 0 0 15px; font-size: 14px;"><strong>1. What to communicate</strong>- Imagine you are a customer visiting your online store for the first time. What kind of information would you like to have at the tip of your fingers? Some examples include information on: the company, who to contact with questions, how to make a purchase, the return process, shipping. Compare your ideas with the previous analysis of your competitors’ CMS pages, and create a final list of topics you’d like to communicate.</div>
<div style="padding: 0 0 0 15px; font-size: 14px;"><strong>2. How to communicate it</strong> &#8211; The tone of voice and your content should reflect your company&#8217;s culture. Keep in mind that even if your culture is friendly and relaxed, CMS pages like the Terms and Conditions, or the Privacy Policy are legally binding, so consult a legal advisor.</div>
<h2><span style="color: #6b7c5b;"><span style="color: #f2a9cd;">3.</span> Decide which type of CMS page you need</span></h2>
<p>CMS pages fall into one of three categories. We listed each type, recommended important pages and detailed their purpose. Whether you are looking to write content from scratch or rewrite an existing page, remember that each type is necessary because they each affect your company differently.</p>
<div style="padding: 0 0 0 15px; font-size: 14px;"><strong>a. Information Pages</strong><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">About Us&#8221;, &#8220;Contact Us&#8221;</span><br />
Tell compelling stories and inspire your shoppers with these pages to build trust in your brand. The more human your company appears, the more trust you generate; and trust is directly related to sales. This applies to all online stores, regardless of your product.</div>
<div style="padding: 0 0 0 15px; font-size: 14px;"><strong>b. Process / Procedure Pages</strong><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Shipping Policy&#8221;, &#8220;Refunds and Exchanges&#8221;</span><br />
Explain every step of the purchasing process, including delivery procedures. If you sell internationally, explain how it works. If you offer discounts, include an explanation of how they are redeemed and if they are cumulative. If customers can return your product, make sure you clearly state how to return it, under which conditions, additional costs, whether return postage is included and whether they’ll receive a cash or store credit.</div>
<div style="padding: 0 0 0 15px; font-size: 14px;">
<p><strong>c. Legal Pages</strong><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Terms and Conditions&#8221; or &#8220;Secure Payment”</span><br />
Protect your company with legal documents. As your company will be legally bound to them, consult a legal advisor to ensure you are fully protected. We’ll talk about them in detail below.</p>
</div>
<h2><span style="color: #6b7c5b;"><span style="color: #f2a9cd;">4.</span> Find the perfect page title</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes it can be hard to find the perfect title for your pages. No worries! We put together this list of common CMS pages, a short description of each and two catchy titles to get you started.</p>
<p><strong>Company Information Pages</strong></p>
<div style="padding: 0 0 0 15px;">

<li>Beauty Deals</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Legal Pages</strong><br />
Due to the nature of these pages, we suggest keeping these titles as they are so that they are easy to find.</p>
<div style="padding: 0 0 0 15px; font-size: 14px;">
<p style="margin: 0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms and Conditions</span> – define your company, its official name, location, jurisdiction, as well as any copyrights and trademarks. Next, define your product, its uses, warranties and limitations. List the selling process in including all the conditions of sale. Include a “limitation of liability” that limits damages resulting from the use of your product. Finally, include a modification clause that allows you to periodically update this document. Draft your <a href="https://termsfeed.com/generator/new/terms-conditions?utm_expid=86438702-166.CGO3vkkrS3u2YOz1dy4Nlg.0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftermsfeed.com%2Fterms-conditions%2Fgenerator%2F" target="_blank">terms and conditions using this generator</a>, then have your lawyer review the document.</p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px; margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
<li>Terms of Use</li>
<li>Terms of Service</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span> – detail your policy on customer data. It should answer: What customer information do you collect, which do you store, do you track customer activities, and how is that data used?</p>
<p style="margin: 0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secure Payment</span> &#8211; clarify your payment solutions and detail the payment structure, deadlines, processes, verification, and what happens when payments aren’t completed. If you charge additional international payment processing fees, include them here.</p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px; margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
<li>Payment Terms</li>
<li>Payment Options</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community Rules</span> – list rules for interacting within your community, like writing reviews or participating on your forums and blogs. Be sure to state consequences of not abiding by the rules, to include content removal or banned user accounts. Also remember, as important as it is to list these rules, they are only effective if you actively enforce them.</p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px; margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
<li>Community Guidelines</li>
<li>Respect the Community</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2><span style="color: #6b7c5b;"><span style="color: #f2a9cd;">5.</span> Write the content</span></h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Here are tips to keep in mind when writing CMS page content:</p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px; margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
<li>Cover only the topics relevant to your industry and your company.</li>
<li>Write in simple English, using legal jargon only when necessary.</li>
<li>Avoid unclear or undefined points, be specific.</li>
<li>Communicate with a voice that represents your company’s culture.</li>
<li>Keep your text short and concise.</li>
<li>Organize your content into appropriate sections and headings.</li>
<li>If you don’t have enough content to fill out an entire section, combine them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve given you all the tools you need to write great CMS pages. Now it’s your turn.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6b7c5b;"><span style="color: #f2a9cd;">6.</span> Integrate your pages</span></h2>
<p>If you are a PrestaShop user, your online store comes with a set of default pages. It is essential that you update these pages and create new ones once you have new titles and content ready. Access them through your BACK OFFICE &gt; PREFERENCES &gt; CMS.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6b7c5b;"><span style="color: #f2a9cd;">7.</span> Update and maintain</span></h2>
<p>Keep your CMS pages current with updated information. An outdated Contact Us page with an invalid phone number can negatively affect your company&#8217;s reputation. More importantly, an obsolete Legal page can result in serious legal issues! Set a reminder to update and maintain your CMS pages.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What will Search Engine Optimization look like in 2015? It&#8217;s become something of a tradition for SEO professionals to come up with their predictions at the end of each year: are we looking at a full-scale revolution or a few minor changes? Here&#8217;s what I think we&#8217;re in for in 2015&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19074" title="Blog-Post-SEO2015" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/Blog-Post-SEO2015.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="305" /></p>
<p><span id="more-19063"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">SEO will be (almost) the same in 2015</span></h4>
<p>Panda, Penguin, Hummingbird, Caffeine &#8230; Although Google is always telling us about its latest algorithm updates, SEO in general remains largely the same, with, of course, a few developments here and there. As the saying goes, if the algorithm ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it.</p>
<p><strong>As far as I can see, Google Search is striving to achieve two goals:</strong></p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px;">
<li>To make its users happy by displaying high-quality, relevant results</li>
<li>To increase revenue from these search results through AdWords</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Google&#8217;s aim is not to provide you with free traffic</strong>, generating more free traffic is the purpose of SEO. I think it&#8217;s vital to make this distinction.</p>
<p><strong>Since 1998, Google&#8217;s algorithm &#8216;recipe&#8217; has used more or less the same ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px;">
<li>Relevance (how well your website corresponds to the search query)</li>
<li>Popularity (how many links direct towards your site)</li>
</ul>
<p>Given <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-search_engine-ww-monthly-201310-201410" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s worldwide monopoly over the market</a>, this strategy is clearly working, so I see no reason why Google would decide to rethink its algorithm.</p>
<p>So, my prediction for 2015 is that SEO will continue to develop along much the same lines (an opinion shared by <a href="http://moz.com/rand/google-seo-dont-actually-change-much/" target="_blank">Rand Fishkin, founder of Moz</a> on his blog.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">So, how will SEO develop exactly?</span></h4>
<p>Here at <a href="http://www.prestashop.com" target="_blank">PrestaShop</a>, we are committed to discussing e-commerce with e-merchants. Since SEO is an essential growth tool for small stores, I have put together my list of predictions for the future of e-commerce SEO.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">2015 will be all about mobile</span></h4>
<p>Back in early 2014, <a href="http://searchengineland.com/matt-cutts-mobile-queries-may-surpass-pc-year-186816" target="_blank">Matt Cutts</a> had already predicted that numbers of search requests sent from mobile devices would surpass those of PCs.</p>
<p>Likewise in the UK, <a href="https://www.internetretailer.com/2014/09/02/mobile-visitors-overtake-desktop-visitors-rthe-uk" target="_blank">Internet Retailer announced in September</a>, that mobile and tablet traffic to its retail site had overtaken that of PCs.</p>
<p>Below you can see a comparison of global traffic from PCs, smartphones and tablets compiled by StatCounter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop+mobile+tablet-comparison-ww-monthly-201311-201410" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-19064" title="graphe" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/graphe.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>If you play around a bit on the StatCounter website and filter the results by country, you will in fact see that mobile is already the dominant channel in certain markets. I&#8217;m especially thinking of <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop+mobile+tablet-comparison-IN-monthly-201311-201410" target="_blank">India here, where mobile is leagues ahead of the rest, accounting for 70% of total traffic</a>. But whatever your target location, the trend is catching.</p>
<p>You should also bear in mind that more and more people are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/a-majority-uses-mobile-as-second-screen-2013-5" target="_blank">using their smartphones while watching TV</a>.</p>
<p>The mobile and tablet boom is well and truly underway, and to come back to SEO, Google – who is also seeing growth in mobile traffic – wants to satisfy its users by providing as many mobile-compatible hits as possible. That&#8217;s why Google favors online retailers with mobile sites, to the detriment of those who are still only desktop-ready.</p>
<p>In the US, Google already displays a site&#8217;s mobile compatibility right from the SERP (Search Engine Result Page):</p>
<div style="height: 445px;">
<p style="text-align: center; float: left; padding: 0 15px;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17888" title="screen-search" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/screen-search-576x1024.png" alt="" width="250" height="442" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; float: left;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17889" title="screen-search2" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/screen-search2-576x1024.png" alt="" width="250" height="442" /></p>
</div>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.stonetemple.com/googles-gary-illyes-discusses-mobile-as-a-ranking-factor/" target="_blank">Gary Illyes</a>, in order to receive this little &#8216;mobile-friendly&#8217; badge of honor on results pages, all you need to do is take the Google Webmaster Mobile-Friendly Test. This tool will let you see whether your site is mobile-friendly and if it meets Google&#8217;s criteria:<br />
<a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/" target="_blank">Take the mobile test</a></p>
<p>If you want to delve even deeper, I recommend reading <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JohnMueller/posts/WT5YccbhkXi" target="_blank">this G+ blog post by John Mueller</a>, which does just that.</p>
<p><strong>My Mobile SEO recommendation for 2015</strong></p>
<p>You will need a mobile-friendly version of your online store. If you want to continue developing your SEO, you have two main options: using a responsive design template (whereby layout changes according to the viewing environment), or a dedicated mobile site, i.e. http://m.example.com.</p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px;">

<li><a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/mobile/8936-shopgate.html" target="_blank">The Shopgate solution for creating a dedicated mobile site</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Mobile SEO prediction</strong></p>
<p>I anticipate that in 2015, or latest 2016, 100% of all Google results matching queries made from a smartphone will be mobile-friendly. In other words <strong>you&#8217;ll no longer see desktop sites on your smartphone</strong>.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">An HTTP-secure year</span></h4>
<p>Google&#8217;s other main campaign for 2014 was to urge websites to switch over to HTTPS from HTTP. They even added it as a <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-starts-giving-ranking-boost-secure-httpsssl-sites-199446" target="_blank">ranking signal in their search algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t get ahead of yourself by thinking this alone will get you on the first page of Google results! However, since every little bit helps, why not give it a try?<br />
<strong>My Security SEO recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Switch your online store to HTTPS in 2015.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">Back to basics</span></h4>
<p>So, here is why I mentioned SEO evolution&#8230; although SEO is undergoing constant change, the process of optimizing your website for Google searches remains largely the same:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;">To come first, you need to have the best content with the best links.</span></p>
<p><strong>Start by identifying keywords</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/find-the-right-seo-keywords-for-your-online-store/" target="_blank">Find the right SEO keywords for your online store</a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">Your New Year&#8217;s resolutions for SEO-friendly content</span></h4>
<p><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-use-your-seo-keywords-to-structure-your-ecommerce-site/" target="_blank">Structure your online store for optimum SEO</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/content-marketing-for-ecommerce-technical-checklist-writing-process/" target="_blank">Then think about your Content Marketing strategy</a></p>
<p>You should also make sure the titles and descriptions you use on product and category pages are properly formulated to maximize SERP CTR and conversion.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">My Link Building recommendation for 2015</span></h4>
<p>Half the battle when creating a good SEO strategy is getting linking right. But that doesn&#8217;t just mean optimizing the tags used in your online store or writing a few blog posts; to increase your SEO in 2015, you will still need links, but they will have to be good quality.</p>
<p><strong>What Google is doing to e-commerce sites with poor links</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19067" title="matt-cutts-vs-netlinking" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/matt-cutts-vs-netlinking.gif" alt="" width="360" height="240" /></p>
<p>Google has declared all-out war on websites selling links, and has even reported them in its Webmaster Guidelines violations. From a legal standpoint, even though Google doesn&#8217;t make the law, it really does rule over the Internet, so I would recommend taking extreme precaution if you don&#8217;t want to get caught by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Penguin" target="_blank">PINGUIN</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, here are a few Link Building tips for 2015</strong></p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px;">
<li>Don&#8217;t construct your own link building if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing.</li>
<li>Enlist the help of an SEO agency or professional.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use (or stop using) link-selling sites.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t optimize by using keyword-rich anchor text such as my keyword.</li>
<li>Use unique anchors or ones that contain the name of your website, for example.</li>
<li>Think about consistency with websites that redirect to you or your online store.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re still in the habit of exchanging links with other websites, stop right now!</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t get led into believing that link building is just about inserting a few links into blog comments, forum posts or directories.</li>
<li>Remember that a good link is one that will bring in traffic.</li>
<li>Use links that direct to different pages of your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, know that it&#8217;s not true that you need to pay to have links. Remember that your product pages and your blog content can provide you with links just by being top quality.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you a small business with a local storefront thinking about selling online? Not sure if online shopping is a trend or the future? As an ecommerce software provider, we would (of course) say you definitely need an online shop. But just saying so isn’t enough.</p>
<p>Today we support our claim with our article titled, “From bricks to clicks: 5 reasons you need to sell online today.” We’re sharing the limitations of a traditional brick and mortar and showing you how an online shop complements your retail shop to help you get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19051" title="BRICK-AND-MORTAR .small" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/BRICK-AND-MORTAR-.small_.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="305" /><br />
<span id="more-19044"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">1. Your shop is not open 24/7.</span></h4>
<p>When is your current shop open? 8:00AM -7:00PM? What happens to customers who want to shop long after your shop has closed? Closing your shop is literally turning customers at your door, away.</p>
<p>Sure, you can keep your shop open longer. However, the overhead to do so is significantly more than creating an online shop &#8211; especially with PrestaShop’s free open source software. The best thing about online shops? They are open 24/7. By launching one, you easily extend your store hours.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">2. Some customers cannot physically go to your shop.</span></h4>
<p>Many business owners are familiar with this phrase: “location, location, location”. When running a retail shop, the success of your shop is due in large to its location. If it is not convenient for customers to get to your store, you can kiss them goodbye.</p>
<p>Opening an online shop allows everyone in the country, or even the world, to access your shop! Suddenly your shop’s location is no longer an issue. You are no longer limited to selling just to customers in your neighborhood.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">3. Shelf space is limited.</span></h4>
<p>Just as important as your retail shop’s location, is the amount of shelf space you have. As a retail shop owner, you know all too well that products need to be positioned and lit properly in your showroom. This limits the number of products you can display at a given time.</p>
<p>With your online shop, the number of products you can display is unlimited. Your challenge will be to make great product pages that are easy to navigate. Start with <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/diy-ecommerce-guide-to-gorgeous-product-photography/" target="_blank">gorgeous product images</a> then compliment them with <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/sell-more-online-8-tips-for-your-product-descriptions/" target="_blank">great product descriptions</a>. Then help customers navigate your shop with a <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-use-your-seo-keywords-to-structure-your-ecommerce-site/" target="_blank">keyword driven website structure</a>. With these 3 things in place, you are ready to expand your product selection beyond the shelf space of your retail shop.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">4. Profits are limited through one sales channel.</span></h4>
<p>Selling through a retail location is just one of the many channels you can use. Opting for just one channel limits your ability to increase profits because you are limiting your customer base. In short, by limiting customers you also limit your sales.</p>
<p>Grow your business and sell more by adding a new sales channel &#8211; an online shop. You will target a wider customer base, and sell a larger volume of products. This will put you in the position to negotiate better inventory rates from suppliers and increase profit margins for your business overall.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">5. Self-promotions appear untrustworthy.</span></h4>
<p>No matter how great the products you sell are, positive product reviews that come directly from you will always appear sales-y and fake. After all, no shop owner will ever speak badly about their product(s).</p>
<p>This is why having an online shop can benefit your retail shop. One of the greatest advantages of an online shop is the ability to leverage social proof. Customer reviews and testimonials build credibility in your products because this promotion comes from someone who doesn’t benefit from saying that the product is good.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">In a nutshell</span></h4>
<p>If you’re already have a retail shop, your online store simply becomes an extension of your current shop. Selling online will extend your shop’s reach, product selection and hours of operation. By doing so, you increase the number of potential customers, which can translate into additional sales.</p>
<p>Have we convinced you to open an online shop to expand your brick and mortar store?
